# Academic Résumé
A single-page, one-column resume for M.S./Ph.D. student. 

## Features

- Easy to further customize or extend.
- Full support for unicode characters with \XeLaTeX\.
- Modified from Sourabh Bajaj's program [sb2nov](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume?tab=readme-ov-file) or [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/software-engineer-resume/gqxmqsvsbdjf).

## Usage

Compile tex on your Computer

If you only need a résumé in English or have installed Adobe Simplified Chinese on your OS, **It would be better to clone only the master branch,** since the Simplified Chinese fonts files are too large.
